I am a long-time community and conference organizer based in the Hudson Valley, New York. My focus is on helping everyone translate awareness of technology into actionable learning with impact on their careers, products, and communities. I think about community in three ways:

 * `Building` communities | bring people together to build or share expertise.
 * `Skilling` communities | create events and content to help them learn.
 * `Amplifying` communities | showcase local experts & spotlight diverse voices.

I hope to document my past efforts and keep this page up to date on current and future initiatives that contribute to these three areas of interest.
