# Nitya Narasimhan, PhD

Welcome to the GitHub Repository for my personal website. My goal is to use this to document both my personal and professional journeys in technology and community development. It is my way of owning my own narrative - but also helping people get a better sense for who I am, what motivates my work ethic and creativity, and why I believe deeply in community empowerment and democratizing AI education.


## 5 Things To Know

1. **I am a Parent.** This is my north star when it comes to decision making in almost every context. I believe we need to leave the world a better place for the next generation, and pay it forward by using our lived experiences to cultivate curiosity, creativity and community in meaningful ways.

1. **I am a PhD & Researcher** I spent the first 15+ years of my technical journey as a researcher, first doing my PhD, then at Motorola Research where I started as a Senior Staff Researcher, and ended my tenure as a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff. I managed teams (and recruiting), univeristy relationships (and funding), and drove significant projects in context-aware frameworks, mobile advertising, social search, social television and ad-hoc networking middleware. It led to 25+ patent filings and 12+ issued patents.

1. **I am a Community Builder.** Over the past decade, I have become deeply invested in fostering technical communities in the Greater New York region. I founded Google Developer Groups in New York City & Hudson Valley, helped reboot Meteor meetups in both regions, and am currently incubating the AI Developers & Entrepreneurs meetup in NYC. I've run multi-track conferences, and multi-week study camps - with the driving goal of _connecting_ community members, _empowering_ first-time speakers, and _educating_ beginners and experienced developers on the latest technologies and tools with events featuring subject matter experts.

1. **I am a Technology Builder.** With 30+ years in the industry, I now consider myself an _expert generalist_ that has both breadth and depth of experience working in research, development and academic contexts. It gives me the unique ability to connect the dots between diverse stakeholders (engineering, marketing, user experience) and move rapidly from plan to prototype, picking up just the right level of tooling and topic expertise needed to get the job done. This skill has allowed me to be even more productive in the era of AI where I can now work with a virtual team of agents to iterate rapidly on ideas and _build through experimentation_ in ways that were unimaginable before.

1. **I am a Visual Storyteller** I have hand-written and doodled notes to help me learn, my entire life. It was only in community engagements that I realized _sketchnoting_ was a skill in its own right. And it was only after I joined Microsoft as a developer adovcate, that I realized _visual storytelling_ was a powerful tool for information sharing and actionable learning on a global scale. It provides visual learners (like me) an alternative way to process complex ideas - helping make intutive leaps of understanding through metaphors, and use colors and graphics to boost signals.

## My Objectives in 2025

1. Capture content from 30+ years of tech in one place (repo)
1. Give readers tools to help them find & learn things about me
1. Give myself tools to help manage & mondernize content for the AI era
1. Pay it forward by sharing new content that helps others learn.

And beyond everything - **cultivate curiosity** and challenge everything! We are in an extraordinary era for learning and building with AI. Doing this responsibly requires deep understanding of the tradeoffs we make and expertise in using tools effectively.

Let's Build The Thing!
