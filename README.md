# Welcome

Welcome to my personal blog and website. 

The earlier version of this site used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the [hugo-clarity](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity#features) theme. Recently I've begun to use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus) for a number of (work) projects, and wanted to explore richer features and customization. 

Dogfooding it on my personal blog seemed a good forcing function. Some things about Docusaurus:
 * It supports Markdown and MDX (JSX-flavored Markdown) for content
 * It is a "rising star" in JavaScript-based static site builders 
 * It is increasingly being used for documentation sites from industry and open-source orgs
 * It feels eminently customizable (themes, plugins, React components)
 * It supports multiple content styles - blogs, pages, docs - that give me flexibility

What's the downside?
 * As a web dev, I know there are performance and standardization issues with such frameworks
 * I want my content to remain portable, and using MDX may lock me down (or require work to port)
 * It is a fast-evolving platform from Meta, so I need to keep up with changes where possible.

 That said, I've always given up on blogging before - and I'm hoping that the use of this framework as both a content target (my blog) and a platform target (testbed for experiments) keeps me engaged longer.

 With that, welcome home!
